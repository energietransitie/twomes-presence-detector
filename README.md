## General info
The Twomes Presence-Detector example sends [generic data sent by any Twomes measurement device](https://github.com/energietransitie/twomes-generic-esp-firmware#readme) to a Twomes server. In particular, it also sends presence detection data to the Twomes server.

## Deploying
To deploy this software, see the [deploying section in the twomes-generic-esp-firmware library documentation](https://www.energietransitiewindesheim.nl/twomes-generic-esp-firmware/deploying/prerequisites/). The firmware needed can be found as a [release from this repository](./releases).

## Developing
To develop software for, or based on this software, see the [developing section in the twomes-generic-esp-firmware library documentation](https://www.energietransitiewindesheim.nl/twomes-generic-esp-firmware/starting/prerequisites/)

## Supported devices
This example was tested on:
- [M5Stack CoreInk](https://github.com/m5stack/M5-CoreInk)

This example still needs to be tested n:
- [LilyGO TTGO T7 Mini32 V1.3 ESP32](https://github.com/LilyGO/ESP32-MINI-32-V1.3)

## Features
The example features generic firmware tasks, including Bluetooth-based presence detection.
